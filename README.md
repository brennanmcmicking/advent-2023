# Welcome

This repo contains my solution to 2023's Advent of Code. I've elected to solve the problems in Rust instead of
the more familiar C, C++, Java, Python, JS/TS, ... because it's fun to learn something new.

This README will likely never serve as anything more interesting than the above message. I'm not a keener on
blog posts.
